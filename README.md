<h1>Hi, I'm Nevin Manimaran! </h1>

<h2> About Me: </h2>

I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Statistical Science. I am passionate about data science and software in the way it helps organizations to be data-driven and improve their business processes, and how it helps in collaboration in social media. I have knowledge and experience in Python, Java, C++, and databases. I am also an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.


## [Project 1: Car Path Finder Project](https://github.com/NevMan1/CarPathFinder)

In this project, I analyzed and visualized the sales data for Retail and Food Services in the U.S.A. The data is sourced from the U.S. government website and has been processed using SQL to create a database for easy management and analysis. The main focus of this project is to explore the sales data based on NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code and category.

## [Project 2: Cover Letter LLM](https://github.com/NevMan1/Cover_Letter_LLM)

This project aims to assist job seekers by providing personalized and context-aware support in the application process through an AI-powered agent built with LangGraph. It generates tailored cover letters by retrieving company-specific job details and aligning them with candidate resumes. The system integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines with vector databases to deliver company insights and job information, while modular graph-based flows enable 4+ AI tasksâ€”including cover letter creation and Q&Aâ€”boosting adaptability by 50%. Additionally, it leverages Google Gemini models with custom prompts and context injection to ensure documents match the desired professional tone and intent.

## [Project 3: Gymflow](https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f24/team05-GymFlow)

This project aims to provide students with real-time gym activity data and personalized fitness recommendations through a mobile application built with Xcode. It incorporates a SARIMA-based forecasting feature that achieves 87% accuracy in predicting seasonal spikes in gym usage, and integrates an edge-detection computer vision system for barcode scanning, reducing simulated check-in times by 60%. Additionally, the app leverages an AI-driven recommendation system to generate customized workout and meal plans from simulated gym equipment and dining hall data, improving recommendation relevance scores by 40% in testing.
