<h1>Hi, I'm Nevin Manimaran! </h1>

<h2> About Me: </h2>

I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Statistical Science. I am passionate about data science and software in the way it helps organizations to be data-driven and improve their business processes, and how it helps in collaboration in social media. I have knowledge and experience in Python, Java, C++, and databases. I am also an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner.


## [Project 1: Car Path Finder Project](https://github.com/NevMan1/CarPathFinder)

In this project, I analyzed and visualized the sales data for Retail and Food Services in the U.S.A. The data is sourced from the U.S. government website and has been processed using SQL to create a database for easy management and analysis. The main focus of this project is to explore the sales data based on NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) code and category.

## [Project 2: Cover Letter LLM](https://github.com/NevMan1/Cover_Letter_LLM)

This project aims to predict the quality of wines using various machine learning algorithms. It utilizes the MLflow platform to manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment on AWS EC2.

## [Project 3: Gymflow](https://github.com/ucsb-cs184-f24/team05-GymFlow)

This project aims to revolutionize the way banks market to their customers by leveraging machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their account history, credit scores, and demographics. By gaining insights into distinct customer groups, banks can tailor their marketing and customer acquisition strategies for optimal results.
